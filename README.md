# Cybersecurity Datasets for Bidirectional RNNs Study

This repository contains datasets used in the study "Securing the Digital Landscape: Bidirectional RNNs for Cybersecurity Resilience," aimed at enhancing cybersecurity measures through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Datasets Overview

The datasets are divided into three categories: training, validation, and test. Each set is crucial for developing and validating the Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks model described in the paper.

- `cybersecurity_training_dataset.csv` - Used for training the model, containing a wide range of cybersecurity incidents with corresponding features.
- `cybersecurity_validation_dataset.csv` - Helps in tuning the model parameters and prevents overfitting.
- `cybersecurity_test_dataset.csv` - Used for evaluating the model performance in a simulated real-world scenario.
